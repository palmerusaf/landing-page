 ## Motivation

 The motivation behind this project was to further practice and improve my css abilities, as well as my html structuring.

 ## Lessons Learned

 When I first started this project my css quickly because a convoluted mess before I could even finish the first section. It was obvious that I could not continue without trying to implement some sort or organization structure. After some googling a came across the BEM method which stands for Block Element Modifier. This help flatten my nested code and make my css far less confusing. I used this method in addition to scss, which is a great tool because it is foldable and scope-able.

 ## TO-DO

 Customize the content in this project, use it to link to other projects, and go back to implement BEM with scss in previous projects.
